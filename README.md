# IP-Calculator
A simple IP calculator for calculating address, netmask and other necessary network information 

Every newbie programmer will create a calculator project eventually. My husband (network engineer) gave me a good idea. Creating not just a calculator, but IP calculator! 
I can make a project plus practice with little network knowledge. Oh, that was a headache! However, the result is marvelous (for me). 

Right now the calc can calculate: 
- address, 
- netmask, 
- network,
- broadcast
- first and last hosts 
- number of hosts in the network

Its also possible to calculate subnet if you need to. Just tick the checkbox, and the field for input will appear. 

The program also have validation if the fields are empty, or the values are lesser or greater then needed.
